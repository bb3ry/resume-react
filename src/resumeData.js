  "aboutme":"I have been at many different roles from sales to construction. I've always had a passion for computers and for the past 7 years have been learning more and more about developing through various projects on my own. From building anf running ecommerce dropshipping businesses using shopify as well as wordpress/woocommerce, to developing and maintaining a fully automated, dynamically generated sports-based web app, with concurrent users up to 50k at times, all while maintaining the same performance as if no users were there.  I have LEMP and LAMP stack experience, managing dedicated servers(Apache/NGINX)(CentOS/Ubuntu), vps, cloud (Digitalocean/OVH) handling everything from building, migrating, database management, auth, security, nginx reverse proxy, and performance... You name it I handled it. Any bugs along the way, its up to me to fix and deploy for many eager fans!",
